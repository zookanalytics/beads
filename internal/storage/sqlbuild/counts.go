// SearchCountsSQL renders the counts mega-query: full issue rows aliased "i"
// plus labels JSON, dep/rdep/comment counts, parent ID, and dependency JSON,
// for one table family. whereSQL/orderBySQL/limitSQL may be empty; the
// reverse-blocker count unions wisp_dependencies only when the caller has
// probed that the table exists.
//
// The WHERE filter is applied to the main table in an inner subquery, BEFORE
// the aggregate LEFT JOINs. The filter only ever references issue columns (never
// the aggregates) and the joins are all LEFT JOINs that preserve every main row,
// so filtering before vs. after the joins yields the identical row set — but it
// changes the plan Dolt picks: instead of materializing the
// dep/rdep/comment/label/parent aggregates and joining them to every main row
// before the WHERE prunes the result, the joins now drive off the
// already-narrowed set. That is the win for the narrow ephemeral-work searches
// that dominate the hot path.
//
// ORDER BY and LIMIT stay in their original position after the joins. Some
// callers (the ready-work counts path) pass a parameterized ORDER BY, so it must
// appear exactly once to keep the placeholder/arg counts aligned; and several
// callers depend on the final SQL row order, which only a post-join ORDER BY
// guarantees.
//
// The scan side is issueops.ScanReadyWorkRowWithCounts, which scans
// IssueSelectColumns positionally followed by the six extra columns in the
// order projected here.
